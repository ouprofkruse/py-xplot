# py-xplot
A python/matplotlib implementation of the xplot drawing primitives using python 3 and matplotlib.

This projects is mainly intended to support the [tcptrace](http://tcptrace.com/) project. tcptrace relies on Tim Shephards "xplot" file format for visualization. Over the years several programs have been created (see the tcptrace web site and [jsplot](https://github.com/pxslip/jsplot)).

This is a work in progress.
